STATA do-files and R scripts from past academic projects and research

I have separated the files and scripts into two folders. One is for the assignments and projects I completed during my undergraduate degree labeled "Academic Projects," and the other holds STATA do files from my experience working in the Undergraduate Research Lab at UCSD labeled "URL Files."
