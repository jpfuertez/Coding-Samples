*>>>>>>>>>>> QUESTIONS <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
***********************************************



/* Load the "auto" dataset */
sysuse auto, clear

/* Question 1: Describe the dataset */
describe

/*There are five different types of variables: string,int, float, and byte. String variables are non-numerical variables like names, 
in this case the make of each vehicle. Int, float, and byte are all numerical values with the difference between them being the size of the number in 
each type.*/

/* Question 2: Calculate correlation coefficient between weight and price */
corr weight price

/* The value 0.5386 indicates that the relationship between weight and price show a positive relationship
meaning as weight increases so does price.*/

/* Question 3: Generate scatter plot for weight vs. mpg 
Hint: use the "scatter" command*/
scatter weight mpg

/* The plot suggests a negative linear relationship since weight decreases as miles per gallon increases.*/

/* Question 4: Keep selected variables */
keep mpg price weight foreign

/* Question 5: Calculate summary statistics for mpg */
sum mpg, detail
 
/* mean=21.2973; standard deviation=5.785503; median=20; range=29*/

/* Question 6: Calculate summary statistics for mpg using domestic cars only */
sum mpg if foreign==0, detail

/* mean=19.82692; standard deviation=4.743297; median=19; range=22*/


/* Question 7: Perform hypothesis test for mean mpg difference 
Hint: use the "ttest" command*/
ttest mpg, by(foreign)

/*The null hypothesis is there is no statistically significant difference between
foreign and domestic cars. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a statistically 
significant difference between foreign and domestic cars. The results of the test showed
that the t statistic is -3.6308 indicating a strong difference in mean between foreign and domestic cars on average.*/

/* Question 8: Run regression for mpg vs. price, weight, and foreign */
regress mpg price weight foreign

/*Beta 3 was shown to be  -1.855891 in the regression meaning when the car is foreign (foereign==1)
the mpg is reduced by 1.855891 on average. However, it had a p-value of 0.154 indicating the coefficient is statistically insignificant*/

/* Question 9: Create a dummy variable "Domestic" */
gen Domestic = (foreign == 0)


/* Question 10: Run regression for mpg vs. price, weight, and Domestic */
regress mpg price weight Domestic

/*Beta 3 in this regression was 1.855891 meaning when the car is domestic, the miles 
per gallon increases by 1.855891 on average. This model is more flexible than the model in question 8
because it shows an increase in miles per gallon if the car is domestic instead of a reduction in mpg
if the car is foreign which is less impactful of a statistic.*/

/* Question 11: Create "fuel_efficiency" variable and run regression */
gen fuel_efficiency = mpg/price

regress fuel_efficiency weight foreign

/*Beta 1 is  -2.66e-06 meaning a one pound increase in weight reduces fuel efficiency by 2.66e-06 on average.
Beta 2 is  -.0020212 meaning if the car is foreign, the fuel efficiency is reduced by .0020212 on average. 
Both coefficients have a p-value of 0 meaning they are both statistically significant.*/

/*

I used Chat GPT to help me understand why I was getting errors in my code and it showed me examples of how
to use certain commands that confused me. It was extremely useful to me because it gave me a direct, useful answer to my questions 
that actually worked when I ran the code.
