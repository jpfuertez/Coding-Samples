*>>>>>>>>>>> QUESTIONS <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
***********************************************

/* Question 1: Load and describe the dataset */
use twoa.dta

sum kidcount morekids boy1st boy2nd boys2 girls2 samesex multi2nd agem1 aged1 ///
agefstm agefstd workedm workedd weeksm1 weeksd1 hourswm hourswd incomem incomed ///
faminc1 nonmomi


/* Question 2: Estimate the effect of fertility on labor supply by OLS */
reg workedm morekids, robust

/* The estimated coefficient is -.130536 and it might be biased because of the possible presence of reverse causality where having morekids
can reduce the hours worked and working more can also decrease the amount of kids. */



/* Question 3: First stage regression of morekids on samesex */
/* I expect there to be a positive relation because the paper states that parents are much more likely to have 
another child if the first two children are the same sex, so when the dummy variable is one the coefficient should be positive
to increase the variable of more children.*/

reg morekids samesex, robust

/* The coefficient .2153336 can be interpreted as the positive relationship between samesex and morekids.
It is statistically significant because the p-value is 0, and it can be economically meaningfull because it shows a positive relationship 
between morekids and samesex.*/

test samesex
/* I do think same sex is a strong instrument because it has a F-statistic of 5112.35 which is much greater
than our chosen value of relevance 10.*/

/* Samesex is most likely exogenous because sex is randomly assigned and there is most likely no omitted variable in the error term
that could be correlated with a variable that has a purely random distribution*/


/* Question 4: Manual 2SLS */
reg morekids samesex, r 
predict double morekids_hat, xb
reg workedm morekids_hat, r

/* The 2SLS gave the estimate -.2904172 where as the OLS gavea less negative estimate of  -.130536.*/


/* Question 5: Automated 2SLS */
ivregress 2sls workedm (morekids = samesex), r

/* The command gives he coefficient  -.2904172 which is the same as the manual 2SLS, but the standard errors are 
a little bit differet because the manual regression uses OLS standard errors which do not equal the correct TSLS standard errors.*/


/* Question 6: 2SLS with more elaborate model */
ivregress 2sls workedm (morekids = samesex) agem1 agefstm boy1st boy2nd blackm hispm othracem

/* This regressions estimates a coefficient of -.4722325 which indicates that there is a negative relationship 
between having more kids and if the mom worked the previous year meaning if there are more kids the mom most likely did not work
the previous year and vice versa. */
